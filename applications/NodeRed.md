## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

Zooper Corp's Node Red Client for Polkadot is a project aimed at bridging the gap between advanced blockchain technologies and everyday users, particularly those who are not well-versed in coding. The project leverages the simplicity and flexibility of Node Red, a popular flow-based development tool, to create an intuitive interface for interacting with the Polkadot ecosystem. This integration is particularly significant in promoting the inclusion of non-technical individuals in blockchain activities, making it possible for them to participate in and benefit from the growing Polkadot ecosystem without requiring deep technical knowledge. Our Node Red client is designed to simplify complex blockchain operations, making it accessible for home automation enthusiasts, educators, and small business owners to integrate Polkadot functionalities into their operations. By providing a user-friendly platform, we enable users to manage blockchain-related tasks with ease, such as tracking cryptocurrency transactions, automating smart contracts, and monitoring blockchain events. The importance of our project in the Substrate ecosystem is underscored by the growing need for inclusive platforms that empower users at all technical levels.

## Maintenance Grant :wrench:

- **Repo(s) needing maintenance:** https://github.com/Zooper-Corp/NodeRed-Polkadot
- **Reason for support:** The project is in active use by projects like [PolkaWatch](https://twitter.com/polkawatch/status/1654124259374145537) requiring ongoing development and maintenance.
- **Overview of contributions:** Enhancing features, fixing existing issues, aligning with the latest Polkadot versions.
- **Project owner's consent:** Confirmed consent from project owners for maintenance and enhancements.
- **Max budget per month:** 500 DOT

## Development Status :open_book:

Library is currently on its first milestone, its usable but lacks proper documentation and extended support for metadata. Also there is no regular update currently when base JS clients is updated.

## Maintenance Responsibilities :nut_and_bolt:

We own the project and we will keep updating it

### Issues we want to address:

1. **Up-to-date Documentation:** The existing documentation is sparse and outdated. We plan to develop comprehensive and user-friendly documentation.
2. **Code Comments and Clarity:** The current codebase lacks sufficient comments, making it challenging for new developers. We will add detailed comments and improve code readability.
3. **Bug Fixes and Feature Enhancements:** We aim to add new features, such as dynamic loading of metadata, to align with the latest updates in the Polkadot ecosystem.
4. **Community Engagement:** Actively engage with the community by responding to issues, discussions, and assisting contributors with their pull requests.

> ⚠️ *All code will keep current MIT license.*

### Maintenance Overview

- **Start Date:** 01/01/2024
- **Sprint/Period Duration:** Typically 8 weeks per sprint
- **Total Duration:** The contract is planned for 1 year
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):** Approximately 0.5 FTE
- **Max budget per sprint/period:** 500 DOT per month
- **Hourly rate:** 100 DOT acknowledging the variable workload each sprint may require

> ⚠️ *At the end of each sprint, a comprehensive report detailing the work done will be provided. This includes a list of addressed issues/bugs/pull requests, time spent on each, and the associated cost. The report format will follow the Milestone Delivery structure, and payments will be processed post successful review and merge of each report by the Web3 Foundation.*

## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign:

**How did you hear about the Maintenance Grants Program?** Our team learned about the Maintenance Grants Program through the Web3 Foundation

In addition to the information already provided, we would like to highlight some pertinent aspects:

- **Work Already Done:** The Node Red Client for Polkadot is a product of our dedicated efforts in the past. It has evolved from a basic concept to a functional tool that is currently in use within the Polkadot ecosystem.

- **Backward Payment Request:** Recognizing the value and impact of the work already completed, we respectfully request a backward payment of 2,000 DOT. This request is made in consideration of the substantial time and effort invested by our team in developing the Node Red Client for Polkadot to its current state. This payment would significantly aid in covering the initial development costs and provide a solid foundation for continued maintenance and enhancement of the project.

- **Collaboration and Contributions:** While Zooper Corp has been the primary developer of the Node Red Client for Polkadot, we have engaged with various community members and stakeholders for feedback and testing. However, to date, no other teams have financially contributed to the project.

- **Previous Grants:** This is our first application for a grant within the Web3 Foundation ecosystem. We have not previously applied for or received any grants for this project.

We believe that our ongoing commitment to the Node Red Client for Polkadot aligns well with the goals of the Maintenance Grants Program, and we are eager to continue our contributions to the Polkadot ecosystem.
